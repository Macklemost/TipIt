## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] The tip amount can be chosen via a slider, allowing for any tip amount to be entered.

## Notes

This was the first time I have ever used Xcode or even looked at the Swift language. A good portion of the time spent on this app was researching how to use different methods and what certain terms meant. Other than my novelty to app creation, my largest difficulty was getting the various actions to happen when I wanted them to. This was typically solved by placing the desired code within the right lifecycle method.
